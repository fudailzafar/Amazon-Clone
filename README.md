# Amazon Clone

Welcome to the Amazon India Clone project! This repository replicates a basic Amazon India product listing page using HTML and CSS. It includes a responsive product grid layout with essential product information and action buttons to simulate an online shopping experience.

### Features:
- **Responsive Product Grid**: Products are displayed in a grid format that adjusts to screen sizes.
- **Product Cards**: Each product has an image, title, price, and buttons for "Add to Cart" and "Buy Now."
- **Header Navigation**: A mock navigation bar similar to Amazon India's, including categories and a search bar.
